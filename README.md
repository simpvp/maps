# <https://simplicitypvp.net/maps>

This repo contains files for simpvp's officially hosted overview maps.

The maps are generated using [mapcrafter](https://github.com/mapcrafter/mapcrafter).

The map tiles themselves are gitignored (they are quite large,) but a list of them along with their checksums can be found in each directory.
If you insist on wanting the tiles locally, then you're welcome to use those lists to download them from simplicitypvp.net.
Just please limit yourself to no more than ~10Mbit/s.

The js has been modified to use the tiles from simplicitypvp.net even when the repo is cloned locally, so it should work to just clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.
